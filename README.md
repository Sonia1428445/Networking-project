# Cisco Airport Management System Project

Welcome to the Cisco Airport Management System project repository! This project showcases the implementation of an Airport Management System using Cisco technologies, aiming to optimize airport operations and enhance overall efficiency.

## Introduction

The Cisco Airport Management System leverages Cisco networking and collaboration technologies to offer a comprehensive solution for airport operations management. This project demonstrates my skills in designing and implementing network-based systems.

## Features

- Secure network design for airport terminals, offices, and public areas.
- VoIP communication infrastructure for staff and passenger information.
- Integration with flight scheduling systems for real-time updates.
- QoS policies for prioritizing critical applications and services.

## Technologies Used

- Cisco Catalyst switches for LAN infrastructure.
- Cisco ISR routers for WAN connectivity.
- Cisco Unified Communications Manager for VoIP communication.
- Cisco Identity Services Engine for network access control.
- Network security features like ACLs and VLAN segmentation.

## Installation

1. Set up the Cisco network devices according to the network diagram (provided or created).
2. Configure VLANs, ACLs, QoS policies, and other network settings.
3. Install and configure Cisco Unified Communications Manager and Video Surveillance Manager.

## Usage

1. Access the Airport Management System applications from devices connected to the Cisco network.
2. Interact with the VoIP communication system for staff and passenger communication.
3. Monitor video feeds and analytics for security and operational insights.
